  "Query to use in Ciao. Setting this is useful when using the
  debugger or running tests if the query is long or complicated
  because it saves from having to type it (or search back for it)
  over and over again. Furthermore, it is possible to set things
  so that this query will be issued any time a program
  is (re)loaded.")

  "Set a default query. This may be useful specially during debugging
or testing sessions. However, as mentioned elsewhere, note that
commands that repeat previous queries are also available. 

This query can be recalled at any time using \\<ciao-mode-map>
\\[ciao-load-query].  It is also possible to set things up so
that this query will be issued automatically any time a program
is (re)loaded. The functionality is available in the major
mode (i.e., from a buffer containing a source file) and in the
inferior mode (i.e., from the buffer running the top-level
shell). When called from the major mode (i.e., from window
containing a source file) then the user is prompted in the
minibuffer for the query. When called from the inferior
mode (i.e., from a top-level window) then the query on the
current line, following the Ciao prompt, is taken as the default
query.

To clear the default query use \\<ciao-mode-map> \\[ciao-clear-query]
or simply set it to an empty query: i.e., in a source buffer select
\\[ciao-set-query] and enter an empty query. In an inferior mode
simply select \\[ciao-set-query] on a line that contains only the
system prompt."
