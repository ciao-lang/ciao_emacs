Return a new string containing the replacements.

Optional arguments FIXEDCASE, LITERAL and SUBEXP are like the
arguments with the same names of function `replace-match'.  If START
is non-nil, start replacements at that index in STRING.

REP is either a string used as the NEWTEXT arg of `replace-match' or a
function.  If it is a function it is applied to each match to generate
the replacement passed to `replace-match'; the match-data at this
point are such that match 0 is the function's argument.

To replace only the first match (if any), make REGEXP match up to \\'
and replace a sub-expression, e.g.
  (ciao-replace-regexp-in-string 
   \"\\(foo\\).*\\'\" \"bar\" \" foo foo\" nil nil 1)

  ;; matched interspersed with replacements for segments that were.
