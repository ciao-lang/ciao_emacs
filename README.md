# The Ciao mode for Emacs

This is an emacs mode that provides syntax highlighting (font-lock),
indentation, source-level debugging and location of errors in source
files, access to manuals, maintenance of changelogs, and other
editing, compiling, running, and debugging facilities for Ciao
programs.

It offers a rich, integrated user interface to the Ciao program
development environment components, including the `ciaosh` interactive
top level and the `ciaopp` preprocessor.
